# MNIST Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits. It uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9).

The goal of this project is to implement concepts and functions by hand using numpy without use of popular libraries such as pytorch or tensorflow.

## Usage

```shell
uv run pip install -e .
uv run train
```
