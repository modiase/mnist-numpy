# Mo-net

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a deep learning library.  
The goal of this project is to implement deep learning concepts and functions by hand using jax/numpy without use of popular libraries such as pytorch or tensorflow by understanding the underlying maths and reading papers.

## Usage

```shell
uv sync
uv run train --quickstart mlp
```
